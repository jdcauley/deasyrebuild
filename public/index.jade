      h4 Hello
      p I'm David. Unfortunately, I must begin our acquaintance with an apology. My pixels have taken it upon themselves to obscure my likeness. You see, my pixels are very limited in their abilities and are madly jealous-- they are only capable of giving answers.
      p You're in luck however because I am human. I know this because I like to ask questions. Questions about you, your goals, and beyond. I'll ask questions that challenge assumptions, spark neurons, and spawn ideas--ideas that resonate with your audience and create value that goes beyond the digits in your budget.
      p Give me a call, we'll discuss what is possible--human to human.

      h4 What I Do
      p People often ask me if I’m a web designer or print designer. Although I can do both, my primary focus is that of a communicator. Let’s discover a concept that champions your message, and I’ll amplify it through design—making the most out of the delivery you choose.
    .col.one-third.borders
      h4 How We Do It
      p 1) We’ll ask each other questions to learn more and to get a feel for the collaborative relationship to follow. If we wish to proceed, an agreement will be signed with milestones to keep us on track. I’ll also ask you to ﬁll out a creative brief questionaire, which crystalizes the objectives, gives me a sense of the big picture—ensuring we make the most of our time.
      p 2) Next, I start digging. What I’m looking for is the strongest link between you or your product and your audience.
      p 3) With this essential truth revealed, it becomes the guide for ideas I will develop through research, exploration, and open communication with you. It’s this informed approach that leads to design solutions that resonate with your audience as relevant and memorable because it speaks to them on a emotional level.
      p 4) After a couple rounds of reﬁnement, it is time to put our ideas into action. Let’s revel in this moment.

      h4 Why Do It
      p With fresh new branding, a website, or promotional piece at hand, you can now face the world with conﬁdence in how you are represented. Likewise, your audience will recognise you as trustworthy, worth their time and perhaps their money.

      h4 About David
      p David grew up in a small town called Homer in central New York in an old home with a big backyard that oﬀered plenty of room to grow an imagination. Thanks to encouragement from his parents amd his art teachers, David realized he had a penchant for creativity. As a teen, David attained a summer job at a small packaging company doing mechanical paste-up where he fell in love with a wax machine. However, the seductive power of the Mac II in the next cubicle would prove to be too enticing.
